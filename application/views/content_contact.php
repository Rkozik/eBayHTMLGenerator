                <span class="dropcap1 dropcap2">Q:</span> <b class="fontWeight-normal underline-on">Selling on eBay is really tricky for me</b>. Cause I'm not the greatest at writing, and
                don't really have enough items to list to really get the experience necessary to learn how to do this properly. Can you help?
            </p>

I also scrimshaw old vintage silver buffalo nickels like hobos used to during the depression. <b class="fontWeight-normal underline-dotted">Any possibility you could make an

                Is there <b class="fontWeight-normal underline-dotted">any chance you'd make one specifically for selling video games on eBay?</b> No offense they look nice, but I think this would work
                better.

                <span class="dropcap1 dropcap2">Q:</span> So I tried making a template for my sick Djinn jewelry and fan-fic auction, but
                it was really hard to complete(borderline impossible really) on my old Android phone. Can you fix that for me?

                Actually I'm big into currency and do show me your art I think I've got some a 1936 nickle or two laying around;
                That's something I have been meaning to get to for a while, I'll put a rush on it;
                Mobile optimization is something that's already in the works. Also, gross dude, eBay djinn fan-fiction is something I wish I never stumbled upon. Teach me to curiously buy things.
